Whether you are looking for a style for an event or just something different to wear out there's styles for (almost) every length of hair. Some are easy enough to do yourself, or with the help of a friend / partner, and others are a bit more elaborate. If there's a style you want to learn how to do, we are more than happy to teach you.

Above the shoulders:
Braids where strands are added every link (like French / Dutch braids) are great options when dealing with shorter hair.

Shoulder length:
This is where braids that extend beyond the scalp start to kick in. Additionally, braids that wrap around the head can be good choices here. On the longer end of shoulder length, buns start to be feasible, and half-up styles can also be great options.

Chest length and beyond:
This is sort of where we start to get into long hair styles. Elegant curls and half-up looks are great options for flaunting the length, elaborate braids are also fun and often functional. Updos can create great formal looks.

 Of course, there's plenty of other styles then those mentioned here. If you find something you want to give a try, stop on by and our team can get you set up. In salon styling services are included in your salon membership at no extra charge.
