When it comes to color, often the tradeoff is damage to the structure of the hair. That damage can cause tangling and a more staw like hair texture. However, for certain hair colors, it may be possible to color your hair without the need to cause damage. In this blog post I want to go over direct dye on natural hair.

First, lets go over some advantages and disadvantages of this process:

## Advantages
* Damage Free
* No harsh chemicals
* Plesent application process
## Disadvantages
* Consistancy
* Limited on vibrancy
* Limited on color choice

So, what colors are possible? Well, because we are adding color, the color you end up with can be no brighter than your current hair color. If you are naturally light blonde you can do more colors than someone who has a natrual dark brown color, and somone with dark black hair may only add tints that will be visable in bright sunlight. In general, purples and reds have the best chance of getting the desired color. This is in part due to many brunettes having red "undertones". Due to us not striping out your natrual pigment we also have to deal with those pigments. If you are blonde and we add blue, there's a chance you might end up with green hair. 

#### Red
This is a prime candidate and our most common color. The biggest risk with this color is not taking, and the opposite risk, not leaving. 

#### Dark Blue
This is typically fairly dark with a slight risk of fading green or turning purple (depending on yellow or red undertones).

#### Purple
This is one of the most consistant colors for direct dye, and typically has no serious fading risk.


Another issue is that everyones hair is different. While key structures are the same, we have had some clients hair not take any pigment. While this is not typical, it can happen.

So, you might be asking? If it's less damaging, why do most salons not offer direct dye on natural hair? It mostly comes down to consistancy. Many clients have misconceptions about hair color. They expect perfection on the first cycle. And one of the best ways to get consistancy is to strip out the natural pigment. The extra damage also is benifical to the salon as repeat business for treatments and more frequent haircuts are required, in addition to the maintance of the color itself. 

Why do we offer this as a service? As a membership based salon, our incentives are exactly the opposite of traditional salons, we want to keep your hair healthy as all those treatments and extra maintance affect us as well. Beyond this, we care about healthy hair. We strongly believe our customers are our best marketing tool.

So, is direct dye on natural hair right for you? Here's a few questions to ask yourself:
Do you enjoy your hair being soft and silky?
Are you worried about damage but want a bit of color?
Are you ok with potential varriance in color?
Are you after a color darker than your natural color?

If you answered "Yes" to all of these, then direct dye might be worth a shot.
