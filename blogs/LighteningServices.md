Lightening services are some of the most harsh processes for hair to undergo. But what makes this service so damaging and what can we do about it?

# The Process
Lightening essentially opens the hair shaft and neutralizes the pigment (melinin) out. When the hair shaft is opened and closed, it does so imperfectly. This breaks "bonds" and portions of the hair shaft. Lightener has a chemical that acts as a "cap" on a chain aminio acid (think breaking rungs on a ladder and sealing the connection points).

# The "Solution"
Lightener is incredibly harsh on hair and leads to dry, frizzy, and rough hair. There are additives for lightener / oxidative color that claim to be able to reduce the damage during the lightening process. These products work by distributing a syntetic molecule that can act as a "ladder rung" in the hair shaft. A portion of the ladder rungs that would have been capped off by the lightener would instead get the synthetic "rung" added instead. The most popular of these products being Olaplex.

Some salons offer olaplex or bond protection, but often at a quite steep additional charge. At Style Connect, all lightening and oxidative color services use a bond protection additive in the process to reduce the damage done to your hair. In our experiance, these addtitives do make a noticable difference in quality of hair after a service.  

# Additional Notes
One thing to note, is that these companies in an effort to increase their own profits often create additional, likely ineffetive, products. Bond restoring shampoos and conditioners" for instance are likely not going to do anything for your hair, as the capped ends of the aminio acids are not possible to un-cap. The reason adding a bond protection to oxidative color is effective, is for making a portion of "capped" ends into ladder rungs before they get "capped off."

Also, as an important note, no product can "restore" damaged hair. While such a product would be amazing, there are many chemical challenges that have yet to be overcome to make such a thing possible. Any product claiming to restore hair is likely lying. The beauty industry is filled with impossible claims, we would like to remind people that extrodinary claims require extrodinary evidance.
