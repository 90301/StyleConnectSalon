If you are interested in growing longer hair, one common thing you might run into are "miricle cure" sorts of products. Things like: "Just mix eggs, flour, and surgar to grow your hair twice as fast" are as common as they are baseless. If you really want to grow your hair out, the truth is, it comes down to time. There are things that can affect hair growth / hair quality that you should be aware of and we will go over those too.

It's important to understand some basics of hair growth. typical hair growth is about 6 inches a year, which means a typical month will only get you half an inch of growth. Some people can grow hair faster, one of our clients seems to grow about 9 inches a year, but this is very uncommon (work on this). So, if you want to grow hair from a bob to past your waist, you might be looking at 5 years of growth. In my opinion, that can be a long time, and in general I've seen two common psycholgically sucsessful strategies for growing your hair.

One is to just not think about it. Granted, it's pretty hard to /not/ do something. If you want longer hair, but you don't really think too much about doing stuff with your hair, it makes the time go by a bit faster. If you are reading this article, you probably don't fit into this category. 

Two is to look forward to new things you can do with your hair at every new lenght goal. If you can't put your hair into a ponytail, being able to do that can be a big step. There's different braids and updos requring different minimum lengths of hair. At tailbone length for example, there's a bun you can do that can hold itself up.

So, what other factors, besides time affect hair growth? Trims / haircuts are the next biggest factor. If you are cutting your hair every month, even only half an inch, it can't get any longer. Even if you are trimming your hair once a year, but you take 3 inches off you've now reduced the growth of your hair to half of the natural growth rate. 

So, we have to ask ourselves why we even trim hair if we are trying to grow it out? The answer comes down to damage. The irony being though, that damage on longer haired people often is not focused near the ends of hair, but in the middle. This is because of how hair grows. Each individual hair on our heads goes through a cycle of growing and falling out (it then starts the cycle over). A typical cycle is about 6 years, however this appears to be normally distributed, with some people being able to grow incredibly long hair by having faster growing hair and/or longer cycles. These cycles are staggered, so it's not like we go bald every 6 years, instead we lose about 100 or so strands of hair a day. If you start to get hair close to "terminal length" (the longest you can grow your hair) then over 90% of your hair is not going to make it to your "ends" and "split ends" could be as high as your sholders. Trimming the last inch won't do much good for a split end 2 ft higher up.

So, what's the solution?
We do individual split end trims. These are sessions where we go through your hair to find damage, and trim  the individual split ends.


Why don't most salons offer this service? There's a realitively small number of clients who are interested in growing their hair long, and typically long haired non-color clients don't make up much revenue for a salon. The get fewer services, and tailoring services towards the lowest revenue customers often makes little sense. 

Why do we offer this service?
